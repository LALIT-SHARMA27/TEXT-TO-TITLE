# TEXT-TO-TITLE Generator using LLM models 
## Introduction
Welcome to our ever-evolving repository—think of it as the buffet of transformers, with a new dish every month! We kicked things off with BART (because who doesn't love a great story?) and next up, we've got T5 
 Model stepping into the spotlight, ready to flex its text-to-text muscles. 

But that’s not all! We’ve wrapped this brilliance in a neat Streamlit app, making it a one-stop shop for choosing and running your favorite model. Whether you’re into generating titles for research papers or just here to see machines outwit humans at summarizing abstracts, we’ve got you covered. 

Stay tuned as we keep adding new models—because in this kitchen, the menu always gets spicier!

## DEMO
Here i gave my model [Rapid 3D Model Generation with Intuitive 3D Input](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Rapid_3D_Model_Generation_with_Intuitive_3D_Input_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf) abstract and genrate title for the paper.

## Data
The dataset used is the `arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json` file from the ArXiv dataset.
